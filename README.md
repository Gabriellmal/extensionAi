🏗️ VS Code Architect

VS Code Architect is a powerful, AI-driven extension factory that allows you to build, compile, and install VS Code extensions just by describing them in plain English. Powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash, it handles the scaffolding, dependency management, and packaging automatically.

🚀 Features

Natural Language Creation: Describe your idea (e.g., "A tool to format JSON into YAML") and watch the AI build it.

Automated Scaffolding: Automatically generates package.json, extension.ts, and tsconfig.json.

Built-in Compiler: Handles npm install, TypeScript compilation, and .vsix packaging.

One-Click Install: Offers to install the generated extension directly into your VS Code instance immediately after building.

Customizable Output: Choose where your generated projects are saved.

🛠️ Prerequisites

Before using the Architect, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js & npm: Required to build and package extensions.

Visual Studio Code: Version 1.80.0 or higher.

Gemini API Key: You will need a valid API key from Google AI Studio.
